# Quomeda Software Developer Homework

Thank you for taking the time to solve our challenge.
The task is designed to assess your interest, problem-solving skills and experience.
Try to spend 8 hours on this task maximum. It is not a problem if the solution is not pixel-perfect, or if it is not finished. We only want to see how you think, your code and your approach to solving problems.

## The task
Create a full-stack web application that provides some basic data visualization. You will have to figure out exactly what kind of statistics to show (you don't have to show everything), and how you want to present them.

### The data
You only have to use the data that is already provided in this repository in the `/data folder`.
The data is coming from a HCAHPS survey, which describes inpatient experiences in hospitals in different states of the US.
https://healthdata.gov/dataset/hcahps-state  

### Functionality
* The user should be able to select a state, and see related statistics.
* The user should be able to compare two or more states' statistics based on selection.

### Constraints
* There are no language and framework constraints. Use any stack and libraries you are comfortable with.
* You don't have to stylize the site, but you can if you want.

### Other instructions
* Create a new private repo with the results, and invite [borthkror](https://github.com/borthkror) and [DevTeam-Quomeda](https://github.com/DevTeam-Quomeda) users as a collaborators.
* Simply showing tables can also count as data visualization.
* Provide how-to-run or build instructions for the site.
* If you have any questions, contact <marton.czeto@quomeda.com>.

Good luck, and have fun ;)
